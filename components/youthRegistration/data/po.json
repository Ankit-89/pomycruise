          "description": "<p>Feeling unwell prior to joining your cruise</p>\r\n<p>If you feel unwell within 72 hours of the departure of your voyage and feel you are unable to travel as intended, please speak to your booking agent for advice.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In light of the changing picture of public health best practice on cruise ships, we are modifying our processes. New signage placed on check-in counters in the terminal will advise all guests to notify a member of check-in staff if they have experienced fever, diarrhoea or vomiting within the 72 hour period prior to boarding the ship. Handling this information sensitively and respecting guest privacy, our on board medical team will be consulted to discuss the best course of action.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>General emergency signals and procedures</p>\r\n<p>Everyone must attend the Passenger Muster Drill prior to sailing. On arrival your Voyage Card will be scanned electronically to record attendance, therefore please ensure you carry your Voyage Card with you to the Drill.  This applies to all members of your party, including children.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The General Emergency Signal is used to call passengers to their Muster Station, which is an area of the ship designated as an official assembly point, in the event of an emergency.  Your Muster Station is shown on the Safety Notice on the back of your cabin door.  The General Emergency Signal consists of seven or more short rings followed by one long ring on the ship’s alarms. It is accompanied by the same signal on the ship’s whistle. If you hear this signal, whether the ship is at sea or in port, please return to your cabin immediately and collect your life jacket, warm clothing, head covering, sensible footwear and any medication that you may require, before proceeding to your Muster Station. Lifts should not be used, as you may become trapped if there is a power failure. Don’t put your life jacket on until you reach your Muster Station and are instructed to do so, and try not to allow your life jacket belt to trail on the floor. When you reach your Muster Station, please wait quietly for instructions and information over the PA system, or from the Officer in charge of your station.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>If you have mobility difficulties and feel you may need assistance, please tell your Cabin Steward and Reception as soon as possible.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Safety of children onboard during an emergency</p>\r\n<p>All children between the ages 2-12 inclusive are required to wear a safety wristband whilst onboard the ship.  The wristband is issued at check in and must be affixed prior to boarding.  Once onboard the wristband should not be removed. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>This wristband indicates the Muster Station that the child has been designated to.  In the event of a child being separated from their parent during an emergency, the information on the wristband will assist the crew in re-uniting them as quickly as possibly at the correct muster station.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Broadcasts</p>\r\n<p>In the event of an emergency, special announcements are automatically broadcast across all decks and to all cabins. General information announcements are broadcast over the open decks throughout the day, but these are not broadcast into your cabin. If you would like to hear these announcements, please switch to the live mast camera channel on your television.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Fire prevention</p>\r\n<p>All vessels are equipped with automatic fire detection and suppression systems. If you smell smoke or discover a fire, press one of the red manual call point (MCPs) situated around the ship. Although you won’t hear the alarm sound near you, the Bridge will be notified and immediate action will be taken. Once you have activated an alarm, or if you can’t find a manual call point, notify the first crew member you see. If you find yourself trapped in your cabin by smoke or fire, please push the quick-dial button for Reception or dial the ship's emergency telephone number and advise them of your situation. Personnel will be dispatched to assist your escape.   </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Life jackets</p>\r\n<p>Your life jacket is kept in the wardrobe of your cabin. If you are unable to return to your cabin in an emergency, please proceed directly to your Muster Station. Spare life jackets, which are stowed in lockers on deck, will then be given to you by a crew member.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Swimming pools and whirlpool spas</p>\r\n<p>Please keep in mind that the ship’s pools are deep and unsupervised. Our whirlpool spas are the ideal place to relax, but please read the Safety Notices in the vicinity before you get in. Like the swimming pools, the whirlpool spas are also unsupervised and they are relatively deep and powerful.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Man overboard</p>\r\n<p>If you see anyone in the water, or fall overboard, you can raise the alarm by shouting “MAN OVERBOARD”. Immediately throw a lifebuoy, or anything else that will float, over the ship’s side.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Not only will this help the person to remain afloat, it will also mark the spot of where the incident occurred. Then alert a crew member as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Use of electrical appliances</p>\r\n<p>Passengers are not permitted to bring onboard irons, kettles or appliances with heating elements, however hair dryers, straighteners and curling tongs are permitted. Electrical chargers, adaptors and e-cigarette charging devices are to be CE marked and should not be left unattended or left charging overnight or when the cabin is unoccupied. Personal Extension Leads are not permitted onboard unless to be used with essential medical equipment (e.g. CPAP and nebuliser machines). These will be checked for electrical safety along with your piece of medical equipment prior to sailing. Surge protected extension leads are not accepted in any circumstances as they interfere with the ship's electrical distribution.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Going ashore by tender</p>\r\n<p>In some ports it is necessary to anchor off shore rather than alongside the dock or quay. When this is the case, we use a tender to take you ashore. A tender is a small vessel that carries around 100 guests. In order to board the tender, please note that you will be required to use steps (up to 20cm/8 inches high) and navigate the gap between the platform and the tender (of up to 45cm/18 inches). </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In the interests of safety, we require all guests wishing to use the tenders to have sufficient independent mobility to negotiate steps and traverse a gap of up to 45 cm/18 inches. Anyone wishing to board the tender will need to demonstrate this ability via a mobility test prior to tender embarkation by stepping unaided over a distance of 45 cm/18 inches. Children who are unable to step across a gap of this size will be permitted to use the tender service provided their parent/guardian is able to demonstrate that they can carry or pass them safely across the mobility test gap. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>There will be crew members there to guide and steady you as you embark, but they cannot support, carry or lift guests on board the tender for safety reasons. Please wear appropriate, flat, and securely attached footwear, when embarking and disembarking the tender. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>If you use a wheelchair or mobility scooter, please note that you or your travelling companion are responsible for assembling and disassembling your wheelchair/mobility scooter. The crew will endeavour to assist where practical and safe to do so, providing that no individual part weighs more than 20kg/40 lb. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>If you have notified us that you have reduced mobility you will be invited to a tender briefing on board and given the opportunity to take part in the mobility assessment (described above) in advance. This must be completed independently, without any assistance. If an officer decides it is not safe for you to board a tender, please respect their decision as this decision is taken to ensure your safety, in accordance with health and safety law.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Accident prevention</p>\r\n<p>For your safety, we recommend that you use all available handrails in case of movement during periods of inclement sea or weather. There are raised thresholds or doorsills of varying degrees and height throughout the ship, so please take care, especially at the entrances to rooms, toilets and exterior decks. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Always hold the handrails when using stairs, the ship’s gangways and accommodation ladders.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Take extra care on steps in lounges and dining rooms, especially when lights are dimmed.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Please do not climb or sit on handrails.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Outdoor decks and steps become slippery when wet, so please be careful. We suggest you wear rubber-soled, low-heeled or flat shoes on deck. Similar footwear should be worn when using tenders to and from shore.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Take care when undertaking activities and ensure that physical activity is of a suitable level for you.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Certain areas of the ship are marked ‘Crew Only’ or ‘Private’. Due to health and safety and security issues, we would ask you to please respect these signs and not to enter these areas.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Be cautious when opening and closing all doors as the ship’s movement and wind force may affect them. Please keep your hands away from the frames of open doors and lift doors.</p>\r\n"
